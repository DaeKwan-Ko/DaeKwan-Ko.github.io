Dae Kwan Ko is an Assistant Professor - Fixed Term in the Plant Research Laboratories at Michigan State University where he investigates how biological molecules interact with each other, creating biological networks, in plants in response to environmental stress. In his research, he plans to apply his multi-omics modeling approaches to understanding plant-microbiome interactions for plant resilience against climate change. He received a Ph.D. in Plant Biology from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016 where he was advised by Z. Jeffrey Chen, and he received MS in Biological Sciences from Seoul National University and BSc in Crop Science from Konkuk University. He finished his postdoctoral training with C. Robin Buell and Federica Brandizzi. In the Brandizzi Lab, he has been promoted to Assistant Professor - Fixed Term, working on projects funded by Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center. Also, he has recently received a research grant as a PI for single-cell genomics analyses in sorghum.
