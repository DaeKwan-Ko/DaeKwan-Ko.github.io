Dae Kwan Ko is an Assistant Professor - Fixed Term in the Plant Research Laboratory (PRL) at Michigan State University (MSU) where he is dedicated to delving into the intricate web of gene regulatory dynamics that underlies the growth and resilience of plants using the power of genomics. He is deeply passionate about addressing the challenges posed by environmental changes at the intersection of genomics, genetics, and molecular biology. His research vision is centered on developing an integrated research program that combines computational modeling with experimental validation to uncover key molecular components and their functions. He received a Ph.D. in Plant Biology from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016 where he was advised by Dr. Z. Jeffrey Chen, and he received MS in Biological Sciences from Seoul National University and BSc in Crop Science from Konkuk University. He finished his postdoctoral training with Dr. C. Robin Buell and Dr. Federica Brandizzi at MSU.
